// 2. variables
//  used to store data 
// can  be looked at as containers for storing data values
// must contain only letters, digits or $ and _ symbol

// guidelines for naming variables
// must begin with a letter or_
// should not start with a number
// must not be a reserved key word like if, else, boolen, let, var, const etc
// they are case sensetive
// use meaningful names


// var was used in earlier versions but now we use let and const

// examples
// variable declaration
let age;
// variable initialisation
age = 23
// = this is an assignment operator
let studentName = "monica"
console.log(studentName)
// declaring many variables on the same line
let firstName, lastName, cohort, year
firstName = "edwin";
lastName = "agonzebwa"
cohort = 5
year = 2023
 
console.log(lastName)
// dealing with constants
const carName = "subaru"
console.log(carName)
// carName = "Audi"
// console.log(carName)
Const carNumber
